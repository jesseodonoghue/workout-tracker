# Workout Tracker
This app required me to track cardio and resistance workouts over time and display stats with graphs to the user. 

## App Breakdown
The app begins by asking the user to input information for a workout. They can either begin a new workout or continue a workout that's already begun. They will then select either resistance or cardio as their type. Next they will enter all information about that specific workout. Once entry is completed, the workout is saved to the database. When the user clicks on the Stats link they are taken to a page that shows the statistics for the latest workouts.
